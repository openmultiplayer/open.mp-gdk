# open.mp gamemode development kit
This is just a SAMPGDK-like library to have wrappers around open.mp sdk and functions with pawn native names.  
The goal is to have the same wrappers as SAMPGDK (natives only, no support for events) but instead of going through pawn, uses open.mp's SDK, which makes calling them way faster and more efficient
